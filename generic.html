									<p>I'm Caitlyn! I'm in my mid-twenties and am ready to change up my life. I've always been interested in the tech industry, especially since my dad has always worked in tech. I remember as a kid going to dad's work - Gateway. I'll never forget those cow print computers. Some of my earliest memories include playing video games, messing around on the PC, building PCs, etc. I even used to jump on my dad's World of Warcraft games at the age of five when he had to get up and go do something.</p>
									<p>All that to say, I've been interested in this for a long time, and am extremely excited to have those dreams fulfilled. As for myself personally, I'm a fairly creative, very "geeky" kinda person. I'm an avid video-game fan, with some of my all-time favorites including Zelda, Fallout, The Witcher, and many more. I'm also quite a fan of comic books, classic art, and really good food. I have a fantastically goofy Shiba Inu named Katsu. He's five years old and the best boy. I've lived in Georgia my whole life, with the exception of that time I lived in Scotland on and off for about two years. I know what you might be thinking, and yes, it IS really that gorgeous, and yes, the accent really is hard to understand. Ask me about it! </p>
									<p>I'm someone who likes to have a bit of fun in my every day life. I really hope to get to further shine by learning with Actualize. With the enjoyment I feel at making this website, I know I made the right choice in my future career, and I would love nothing more than to take that next step at Actualize!</p>
